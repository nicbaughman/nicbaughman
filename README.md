* I really enjoy reddit & ⚽, So I created a website where fans can upload goal highlights. Those goal highlights can then be used in their club's subreddit. How that works is I built a reddit bot that listens to a specific request and then use the goal highlghts data to make comments within reddit - https://www.reddit-goalbot.com/
